x86_64 Linux Assembly scripts to aid my learning. 
# Contents
The code I write here will be heavily documented as this is my first time learning such a low level language. I've only programmed in Python before so this will be a big jump but I'm really interested in this language so I'm ready to bear any challenge that comes through.
There may be some C files because Assembly and C work very well together and there's no harm in learning a bit of C, is there?
Anyway, I hope these small scripts that I write will be useful to at least one person. That's it.
